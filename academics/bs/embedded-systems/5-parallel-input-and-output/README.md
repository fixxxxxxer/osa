## Parallel input and output

> Minimum core coverage time: 3 hours 

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Describe the appropriateness of different I/O configurations (input, strong drive, weak pullup/pulldown, open drain, tri-state) available in general purpose I/O (GPIO) for a given target application.
- Create programs that perform a set of input/output operations on one more GPIOs using a polled approach.
- Describe how interrupts are supported on the target embedded system(s).
- Create programs that perform a sequence of input/output operations on one more GPIOs using an interrupt-driven approach.
- Discuss mechanisms such as hardware and software FIFOs for buffering data streams. Elective Learning Outcomes:
- Discuss Direct Memory Access (DMA) and describe how it is supported on the target embedded system.
- Create programs that perform a sequence of input/output operations using DMA.
