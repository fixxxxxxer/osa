## Data acquisition, control, sensors, actuators

> Minimum core coverage time: 4 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Describe terms and properties relating to Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) such as
sampling rate, reference voltage, conversion time, precision, range, encoding method, etc.
- Perform voltage to binary and binary to voltage numerical conversions given range, encoding method, and reference voltage parameters.
- Describe DAC and ADC architectural approaches such as resistor ladder, successive approximation, flash, delta sigma, etc. and give tradeoffs such as conversion time and circuit complexity.
- Demonstrate numerical conversion from a physical quantity such as pressure, temperature, acceleration, etc. to voltage or current given an example sensor and its characteristic equation or graph.
- Create programs that use one or more external sensors for monitoring physical properties.
- Demonstrate numerical conversion from voltage or current to a physical quantity such as linear/angular movement, sound, light etc. given an example actuator and its characteristic equation or lookup-up table.
- Create programs that use one or more actuators for effecting physical control by an embedded system.
- Design circuitry that transforms voltage level/current drive from/to external sensors/actuators to that required/provided by a target CPU
