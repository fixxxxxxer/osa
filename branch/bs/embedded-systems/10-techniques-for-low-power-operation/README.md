## Techniques for low-power operation

> Minimum core coverage time: 3 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:
- Describe sources of energy consumption such as toggling, leakage and pin configurations used for minimizing power.
- Describe power saving approaches used in embedded system design and their corresponding performance/power tradeoffs, such as sleep/hibernate modes, peripheral system enable/disable, clock frequency management, etc. and appropriate GPIO configurations during sleep/hibernate.
- Describe wakeup mechanisms such as watchdog timer, real time clock, external interrupts, etc. 
- Write programs that demonstrate minimal energy usage in performing I/O tasks through use of sleep and/or hibernate modes.
- Compute system battery life for an embedded system platform given parameters such as battery capacity, current draw, wake time, sleep time, clock frequency.
