## Computing platforms for Embedded Systems

> Supplementary

#### Elective Learning Outcomes:

- Describe multimedia peripherals found in advanced embedded System-On-Chip implementations such video encoding, audio processing, display processing.
- Compare and contrast performance, power, flexibility tradeoffs for hard core versus software CPUs found in Field Programmable Gate Arrays
- Describe embedded applications that benefit from a multi-core approach.
- Describe embedded applications that benefit from other types of processors for embedded systems: DSP processors, GPUs, heterogeneous SOCs (CPUs/accelerators), FPGA-based processors.
