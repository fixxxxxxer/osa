## Asynchronous and synchronous serial communication

> Minimum core coverage time: 6 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Discuss the concepts of duplex and half-duplex communication.
- Compare and contrast parallel I/O versus serial I/O tradeoffs in terms of throughput, wiring cost, application.
- Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams and signaling levels used in an asynchronous serial interface.
- Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses an asynchronous serial interface.
- Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams and signaling levels used in a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.
- Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.
