## Implementation Strategies for Complex Embedded Systems

> Minimum core coverage time: 7 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Describe the need for structured approaches in writing complex embedded applications.
- Describe techniques used in event-driven state machine frameworks such as events, event queues, active objects, event processing, priority queues, hierarchical state machines, etc.
- Describe techniques used in Real Time Operating Systems such as message passing, preemptive versus cooperative scheduling, semaphores, queues, tasks, co-routines, mutexes, etc.
- Create programs using either a state machine framework or an RTOS (or both) for sample embedded system applications.
