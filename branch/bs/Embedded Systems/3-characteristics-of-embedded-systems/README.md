## Characteristics of embedded systems

> Minimum core coverage time: 2 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Compare and contrast CPUs used for embedded systems versus those used for general purpose computing.
- Evaluate and rank tradeoffs such as cost, power, and performance for different embedded systems applications.
- Describe architectural features of the target embedded system(s) (register structure, memory architecture, CPU features, peripheral subsystems).
- Compare and contrast the different types of processors for embedded systems: CPU microcontrollers, DSP processors, GPUs, heterogeneous SOCs (CPUs/accelerators), FPGA-based processors.
