## Periodic interrupts, waveform generation, time measurement

> Minimum core coverage time: 3 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Describe the basic features and operation of typical hardware timers used in embedded systems.
- Create programs that perform periodic I/O triggered by hardware timer-generated interrupts.
- Create programs that measure waveform characteristics such as pulse width and frequency using hardware timers.
- Describe applications of pulse width modulation.
- Create programs that use pulse width modulation for external device control.
