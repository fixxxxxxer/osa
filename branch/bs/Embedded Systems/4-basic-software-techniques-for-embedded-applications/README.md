## Basic software techniques for embedded applications

> Minimum core coverage time: 3 hours

#### Core Learning Outcomes:

- Manually translate simple high-level language statements to equivalent assembly language.
- Describe the actions of compilation, assembly, linking in the program translation process.
- Describe actions taken by compiler-generated code after system reset but before user application execution.
- Describe memory assignments made by a compiler for global variables, local variables, subroutine parameters and dynamically allocated storage.
- Explain the basic loop-forever structure of an embedded program.
- Design simple programs for embedded system applications including some that include modular/hierarchical programming techniques such as subroutines and functions.
- Demonstrate debugging techniques for simple embedded application programs.
